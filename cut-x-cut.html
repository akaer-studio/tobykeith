            <div class="text-block-6">MIKE HOSTY</div>
            <p class="paragraph p4">A singer-songwriter around my hometown does a bunch of songs with some local flair. He&#x27;s got one about being in love with one of the local TV news anchors and one about tornado shelters called &quot;Fraidy Hole,&quot; which is how country people refer to them.<br>‍<br>Before I went to Mexico, Mike was playing somewhere and I saw him do it, so it reminded me. The song has some miles on it, so I called him and asked if he wanted to play on it if I cut it. I figured everyone in that part of the world would get a kick out of him being on the record. So that&#x27;s him on rhythm and that slide solo.<br>‍<br>Kenny Greenberg had no idea about this song&#x27;s history, so he heard it different from the original. He wanted the guitar lick to echo the vocal. I had trouble getting my brain around that, but it kept growing on me. Now it all makes sense. And that&#x27;s what you want a co-producer to do. I&#x27;ve got my ideas for structure, background vocals and some of that intricate stuff, but a guy like Kenny who has been playing guitar in the studio for years is trying to make the music hook as much as the lyrics do. I rode with him on it and it worked.</p>

            <p class="paragraph p4">You know how people will say, &quot;I ain&#x27;t seen you in a minute?&quot; Well, a peso is so cheap and I&#x27;ve heard it used in Mexico as a way to say we need to go out on the town. &quot;I got a peso in my pocket, let&#x27;s go!&quot; I had that idea in my phone and started working on it during a run. I just sang those words – peso in my pocket – until I landed on something that flowed and tied everything else to it. The rest was just me doing what I do. At first the line I had was about a pistol in my pants – also racy, but pepper worked better for the Mexican theme, it&#x27;s funnier and pops that &quot;p&quot; sound. One of my favorite things I&#x27;ve ever written.</p>

            <p class="paragraph p4">When I first heard the demo, it reminded me of Steve Miller, but then it had a little of a rap to it – not unlike the can of worms I opened years ago with &quot;I Wanna Talk About Me.&quot; Then it&#x27;s got the coolest melodic waterfall and I was like, &quot;Yeah, I gotta cut this.&quot; And it really speaks to the message of this album because that&#x27;s exactly what we&#x27;re doing. We&#x27;re coming out old school.</p>

            <p class="paragraph p4">Three years ago, journalist Robert K. Oermann sent my manager an email saying he was listening to this Keb Mo song and couldn&#x27;t get the idea of me singing it out of his head. So my manager sent it to me. A couple weeks later I was idle somewhere, grabbed my phone looking for something to do and saw the email. Hit the play button and thought, &quot;This is really good and different.&quot;<br>‍<br>You&#x27;d be surprised how many people tell me stuff like, &quot;We saw you in St. Joe, Missouri in 1995. We&#x27;re huge fans, but we love your old stuff better.&quot; You want to say, &quot;If I kept doing the old stuff I&#x27;d still be an opening act.&quot; The stuff that built my first fan base – the first five albums – doesn&#x27;t sound like the next five. But you have to keep growing. Anyway, it&#x27;s a good song ... and funny. Like when he says, &quot;I&#x27;m sitting here, looking back, wearing this stupid sweater. I like the old me better.&quot;<br>‍<br>We did the beer bottle and trash can percussion, had Keb come in and do some guitar work on it and I brought in some great gospel singers. We had fun. I was listening to them singing the bridge when I came up with the &quot;ahs&quot; behind it. I told Kenny to run it back, then sang it so they could do that part. Pretty sure this is my wife&#x27;s favorite song.</p>

            <p class="paragraph p4">The Warren Brothers, who wrote &quot;Red Solo Cup,&quot; contacted our office and said, &quot;Tim McGraw isn&#x27;t doing an album right now, but said if Toby was interested in cutting this song, he&#x27;d sing on it with him.&quot;<br>‍<br>Well, then his label wouldn&#x27;t let him do any outside projects until they finished with his singles and we&#x27;d already cut it by then. Probably would have been a single if he&#x27;d been able to join, but I love everybody who wrote this. I don&#x27;t know that I&#x27;ve met Jessie Jo, but I&#x27;ve known her father Dean for 30 years. Great song.</p>

So I&#x27;m down in Mexico 15 years later, remembered that and wrote it top to bottom. Sent it to him and he&#x27;s like, &quot;M-f this and m-f that. I&#x27;ve got goosebumps!

            <p class="paragraph p4">I&#x27;m running around Grand Lake at Shangri-La Resort and noticed these college kids going in these coves, tying their boats up by the hundreds and it&#x27;s just animal house. Topless girls, naked guys, drinking, smoking weed, blaring country and hip-hop, everyone in the water from 10am to 5pm when they all race back and try to find somewhere to eat. Then they go into town and start partying again. So it started as everybody&#x27;s gone to Shangri-La, but I got hung up on the rhyme and couldn&#x27;t get it to jibe. The little lake near me in Norman where they do that stuff is called Thunderbird, so I took a run at it and it worked. I just had to paint that picture and piece it together. When we cut it, I told them I wanted a Telecaster up high kicking around like Buck Owens. When we were done, everyone was like, &quot;Whew. That was fun!&quot; It comes at you like a freight train.</p>

            <p class="paragraph p4">That&#x27;s my tribute to Prine. John was always sweet to me and was a tremendous influence. He left such a hole that can&#x27;t be filled. There are a lot of tributes out there and I wasn&#x27;t inclined to do one, but I was running one morning hoping to hear something I&#x27;ve never heard before when that came on and blew me away. I went home, pulled it up and started playing it. It wasn&#x27;t until I saw the lyrics sheet in the studio that I realized Mellencamp co-wrote it with him. And then, of course, I could hear him in it, too.<br>‍<br>Prine taught me how to not be scared to say anything. &quot;Come back to us, Barbara Lewis. Hare Krishna, Beauregard.&quot; I asked him one time what that had to do with the rest of the song. He said, &quot;Hmm. I don&#x27;t know. It just sang really, really well.&quot; Okay. To satisfy myself writing, I have to make it all come together. I need a bow on it. John just needed a thread running through a little of it, and didn&#x27;t care if he had to pick up another thread. &quot;She was a level-headed dancer on the road to alcohol, and I was just a soldier on my way to Montreal ... I knew that topless lady had something up her sleeve.&quot; That&#x27;s just fantastic. He challenged me to find that when I write.</p>

            <div class="text-block-6">Toby Keith</div>
            <p class="paragraph p4">I&#x27;m standing on the back of one of a thousand boats tied together on the Fourth of July, 2020. A local radio station is blaring from every one of them because they synchronize the music with the fireworks.<br>‍<br>The guy who owns the big cruiser I&#x27;m on asks me which of my songs I think they&#x27;ll play and when. And I said, &quot;If they play &#x27;Courtesy Of The Red, White &amp; Blue,&#x27; they&#x27;ll probably play a few things – Lee Greenwood and such – and wait to play mine once they&#x27;re really rolling. First time they completely fill the sky.&quot; Sure enough, I&#x27;m the third song. Everybody on the lake is singing, boats are honking and it&#x27;s been a really screwed up year. My buddy looks at me and says, &quot;Happy Fourth of July, Big Dog.&quot; I said, &quot;Happy birthday, America. Whatever&#x27;s left of you.&quot; And then I was like, &quot;I need to write that.&quot; I don&#x27;t watch the news that much, but I read some things and was seeing both sides having concern over the end of democracy. We&#x27;ve fought and divided almost to the point it&#x27;s only about power and winning.<br>‍<br>Charlie Daniels had a song saying &quot;God save us all from religion.&quot; And I&#x27;m thinking, God save us all from politicians. Going to vote has become the lesser of two evils. It&#x27;s not about having the best person, it&#x27;s about throwing in the hammer. For 240 years, people have fought and made this the fastest rising country in the world and the best place to live. I&#x27;ve been to all of &#x27;em – I know. We&#x27;re the best there&#x27;s ever been by a mile and it&#x27;s going to take the kind of fight we&#x27;ve had making it and defending it to get that back if we continue to let it corrode.<br>‍<br>I got it done and thought it was about right, but going in the studio I knew the political lean in there would be a lot more liberal. So when it hit that line about the broken down cities by the left&#x27;s design, I could see the breath-holding. Then I hit &#x27;em with the &quot;right can&#x27;t get it right&quot; and everyone exhaled. &quot;Oh, he&#x27;s pissin&#x27; on all of them. Okay.&quot; Then they were fine with it. Politics has been a shit-show for 15 or 20 years and you almost can&#x27;t get anyone to admit that their side has been as much a part of it as the other. If we&#x27;re divided to the point we can&#x27;t even discuss it, we&#x27;re not going to get anywhere.</p>
